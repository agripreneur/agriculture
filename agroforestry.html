        <h1>üå≥ What is Agroforestry?</h1>
        <p>
            Agroforestry is a sustainable land-use system that integrates trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes. 
            By combining agriculture and forestry practices, agroforestry creates more diverse, productive, and resilient ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional farming, which often focuses on a single crop or livestock type, agroforestry encourages the growth 
            of multiple plant species, including trees, along with crops and animals. This synergy offers a range of environmental, 
            economic, and social benefits.
        </p>

        <h2>üçÉ Core Components of Agroforestry</h2>
        <p>Agroforestry systems generally include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trees or Woody Perennials:</strong> Planted alongside or within crop and grazing areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Food or cash crops like maize, beans, or coffee.</li>
            <li><strong>Livestock:</strong> Grazing animals such as cows, goats, or chickens in a managed ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common agroforestry practices include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alley Cropping:</strong> Growing crops between rows of trees.</li>
            <li><strong>Silvopasture:</strong> Combining trees with pasture and livestock grazing.</li>
            <li><strong>Forest Farming:</strong> Cultivating high-value crops under a forest canopy (e.g., mushrooms, herbs).</li>
            <li><strong>Windbreaks and Shelterbelts:</strong> Trees planted to protect crops and soil from wind erosion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üåæ Benefits of Agroforestry</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Environmental Sustainability:</strong> Improves biodiversity and reduces soil erosion.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Resilience:</strong> Trees store carbon and help mitigate climate change.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Diversification:</strong> Multiple sources of income for farmers.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Soil Health:</strong> Organic matter from trees boosts soil fertility.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üîç Challenges of Agroforestry</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Investment:</strong> Trees take time to yield returns.</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Intensive:</strong> Requires planning and ecological understanding.</li>
            <li><strong>Land Use Conflicts:</strong> Needs careful design to avoid competition with crops.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üåç The Future of Agroforestry</h2>
        <p>
            As the world faces growing concerns around climate change, food security, and land degradation, 
            agroforestry is emerging as a powerful solution. Its ability to harmonize agriculture with nature 
            makes it a key tool for building sustainable and resilient food systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Governments, NGOs, and farmers alike are increasingly turning to agroforestry as a way to restore 
            ecosystems while supporting livelihoods.
