        <h1>üå± What is Organic Farming?</h1>
        <p>
            Organic farming is a method of agriculture that emphasizes natural processes, biodiversity, and soil health. 
            Unlike conventional farming, organic farming avoids the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, GMOs, 
            and chemical additives. Instead, it relies on ecological balance and sustainable techniques to grow crops and raise animals.
        </p>
        <p>
            At its core, organic farming is about working <em>with</em> nature, rather than trying to control it. 
            It‚Äôs a holistic approach to agriculture that focuses on long-term sustainability and the health of the environment, farmers, and consumers.
        </p>

        <h2>üçÄ Key Principles of Organic Farming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soil Health:</strong> Enhancing soil fertility through composting, crop rotation, and green manure.</li>
            <li><strong>Biodiversity:</strong> Promoting a variety of plants and animals to support ecosystem health.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Inputs:</strong> Using natural fertilizers and pest control methods like neem oil or beneficial insects.</li>
            <li><strong>Animal Welfare:</strong> Raising animals in humane, natural conditions with organic feed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üåæ Benefits of Organic Farming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Healthier Food:</strong> Often free from chemical residues and GMOs.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Reduces pollution and conserves water and soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Supports farming without depleting resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Better for Farmers:</strong> Encourages safer working conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üîç Challenges in Organic Farming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lower Yields:</strong> Organic systems may produce less than conventional methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Labor Intensive:</strong> Requires more manual work and attention to detail.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher Costs:</strong> Due to certification and maintenance of organic standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üåç The Future of Organic Farming</h2>
        <p>
            As consumer demand for clean, sustainable food grows, organic farming is gaining traction globally. 
            Governments, farmers, and scientists are working together to improve organic practices, 
            making them more efficient and accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            The future of agriculture may well be rooted in the principles of organic farming‚Äîwhere food is grown with care, 
            consciousness, and respect for nature.
