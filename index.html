    <h1>What is Agriculture?</h1>

    <p>
        Agriculture is the practice of cultivating plants and raising animals for food, fiber, medicinal plants, and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. It is a key component of human civilization, having developed independently in various parts of the world over thousands of years.

    <h2>Key Aspects of Agriculture:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Crop Cultivation:</b> This involves preparing soil, planting, tending, and harvesting crops such as grains (wheat, rice, corn), vegetables (potatoes, carrots), fruits (apples, oranges), and industrial crops (cotton, timber).</li>
        <li><b>Livestock Farming:</b> This refers to the raising of animals like cattle, sheep, pigs, and poultry for meat, milk, eggs, wool, and other animal products.</li>
        <li><b>Fisheries and Aquaculture:</b> While often considered separate, these practices involve harvesting aquatic life (wild-caught fish) and farming aquatic organisms (fish, shellfish) respectively, contributing significantly to food production.</li>
        <li><b>Soil Management:</b> Maintaining healthy soil is critical for productive agriculture, involving practices like fertilization, irrigation, crop rotation, and pest control.</li>
        <li><b>Technology and Innovation:</b> Modern agriculture increasingly incorporates technology, from advanced machinery and genetically modified crops to precision farming and data analytics, to improve efficiency and sustainability.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Agriculture is vital for global food security, providing the sustenance necessary for the world's population. It also plays a significant role in economies, livelihoods, and environmental management. Challenges include climate change, water scarcity, and ensuring sustainable practices for future generations.
